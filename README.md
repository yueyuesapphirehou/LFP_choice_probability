# LFP_choice_probability

This repository contains analysis code for studying how local field potentials (LFPs) in primate visual cortex relate to perceptual decisions. The project quantifies choice probability (CP) from frequency-resolved LFP power and compares pre- and post-inactivation conditions to dissociate sensory and non-sensory contributions to decision-making.

**Overview**

Goal: To investigate trial-to-trial variability in neural population activity and its relationship to visual perceptual choices.

**Methods:**

LFP spectrogram computation (Chronux, MATLAB)

Choice probability (CP) calculation

Statistical testing (Wilcoxon rank-sum, Wilcoxon signed-rank)

Visualization (heatmaps/contour maps, R scripts)

**Datasets:** Electrophysiological recordings from macaque visual cortex during a motion discrimination task.
